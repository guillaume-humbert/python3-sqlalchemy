python-sqlalchemy (0.4.0~beta1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  From version 0.3 to version 0.4 of SQLAlchemy, some conventions have
  changed. Most of these conventions are available in the most recent releases
  of the 0.3 series starting with version 0.3.9, so that you can make a 0.3
  application compatible with 0.4 in most cases. 

  Things that have changed in a backwards-incompatible manner are documented
  in "0.3 to 0.4 Migration" section (#overview_migration) in
  /usr/share/doc/python-sqlalchemy-doc/doc/intro.html file
  
  For a full overview of everything that's new and changed, see
